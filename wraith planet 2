You have successfully defeated the… wraith.
You are breathing heavy and the darkness is affecting your sense of depth.
You quickly run to your ship.

*BANG*

The door shuts and you hear the lock activate.
You run to the other side of the ship, but the door has also been locked.
You slowly walk to the front of the ship and a wraith much larger than the one you had just defeated floats near the nose of your ship.
You slowly back away and try to stabilize your senses and focus on the battle ahead.
The boss wraith slowly floats up and down and suddenly stops.
An ear piercing screech is emitted from the wraith’s mouth.
You cover yours ears and close you eyes.
Suddenly a black barrier surrounds you and the wraith…
