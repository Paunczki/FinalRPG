You live happily ever after in the Chicken village 
Obliterating any enemy that happens to come the way of the Chicken village. 
You are truly happy
Even though you sometimes miss your family you know this is now your life

Every night you look to the stars and hope that your family is safe out there
You always read the golden amulet your grandmother gave you when you were a baby
“Do not go gentle into that good night... Rage, rage against the dying of the light”
Goodbye Asteroid-2576z
