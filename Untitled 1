The year is 4000CE
You live on an asteroid, asteroid-2576z
Your asteroid is doomed for destruction within the next century due to it circling a black hole
Your parents ask you to stay, but you are rebellious and leave for great glory and a better future

You begin to gather your items
Some clothes...
A pair of boots...
A graphene rope...
An oxygen rebreather...
The golden amulet your grandmother gave you when you were a baby, inscribed...
â€œDo not go gentle into that good night... Rage, rage against the dying of the light"
A tear streams down your face
You grip the amulet tighter and know it is time to go
You quickly grab two slices of deep dish Chicago pizza for the road
Your parents proto-polaris v2.3 is waiting
You enter and turn it on
Everything begins to shake
Within a moment your home falls fast until it disappears
