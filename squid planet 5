You try to run and find more resources but a squid catches you.

The squid squeezes you hard with its tentacles.

You are finding it extremely difficult to breathe.

You try to pry the squid off, but you can’t.

You claw at it desperately, fighting for your life.

You flail and strike it, but its grip is unrelenting.

Its hold tightens as you continue to struggle.

Your last thought is of your parents and Asteroid-2576z.
…
...
...
You lose consciousness as the oxygen of your last breath runs out.
You are dead and there is nothing left...
