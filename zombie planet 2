You have successfully defeated these… zombies
You return back to the stop and grab the jerry can
But the radio has miraculously turned on
It begins to make some noise
A high pitch goes off and you hear someone’s voice
“Recording 215. October 19th, 3731CE”
“Set to replay everyday for as long as this system survives”
“Earth has been taken over by the flesh eating virus”
“If anyone is still out there, get out”
“Get out of here!”
“Create new colonies on some of the great habitable asteroids our great NASA has recommended.”
“God Bless You, and don’t forget…”

“RUN!!!”

Frightened you fall onto your back
You get back up and run with the jerry can back to your ship

As you run you realize a sandstorm forming
But at the base of it you notice those are more of those zombies
You run faster and faster

Finally you see your ship in the distance, but a much larger figure standing at the base of it
This seems to be the leader and you know it will put up a big fight. 
You think it would be wise to directly charge at it, but it charges at you first
A battle ensues...
