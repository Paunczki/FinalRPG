You have been floating along in space for a few days now
The proto-polaris v2.3 is running out of fuel and supplies are running short
You see a planet in the distance 
This planet has artificial grooves and lighting, this must mean civilization!
This may be your only hope for survival
You direct your ship towards the planet


You safely land… on a destroyed road
A orange-red sand seems to cover most of the planet
There are mountains of them in the distance
The planet seems to be deserted
You figure it is still best to look around

You follow the road for 34 minutes before you see something that looks like a military traffic stop
You rush over to it
You reach the stop and go inside
You immediately notice an old radio that is completely busted
There is also a jerry can that has luckily contained its contents of rocket fuel
This rocket fuel will easily transport you for the next 2 months.
You continue to look around and notice a glass bowl with some crushed up cylinders
They are about half white and half brown gold
A package sits next to them
You read…
“Cigarettes”
It contains a picture of a woman with the cylinder in her mouth
She has very similar features to you
This planet must have been a colony of asteroid-2576z!

You put down the package and turn around to find a large map covering the back wall.
Written across in a dried up red liquid is “Zombie World” 
This covers up the word NEVADA, USA
...Earth
You are not sure what this means so you begin to head out
But first you realize a calendar dated 3729CE, almost three centuries ago
You exit the shack and instantly see three figures heading towards the way you came from
They look like the lady from the cylinder package
Survivors!

You begin to shout and call at them
They do not respond so you begin to run
You approach closer and closer
Each step closer their features become more apparent
You are a few feet away when you realize these survivors are not like the lady from the package
You now walk towards them and say excuse me
No response
You say excuse me again
Still no response
Maybe they are deaf
You reach out to touch them to get their attention
…
Instantly the one survivor lashes around and tries to take a bite out of you
The other two watch waiting their turn
You have to fight for your life…
