You finally get the chance to walk over to the skeleton 
You manage to pick up a jerry can nearby.
You run back outside of the cave and you manage to make your way back to your ship.

	1. Go down the mountain and fight more chickens (leads you to an advanced chicken society)
	2. Fill up your ship with gas and full speed ahead
	3. Access Inventory
