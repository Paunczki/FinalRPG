You begin by opening the glove compartment
You find a Laser Pistol and a handwritten letter

You open the letter and recognize your father’s handwriting
It reads…
“If you are reading this then I was correct in your choice to leave…
...the Laser Pistol is for you to protect yourself out there…
...if possible, please return once your journey is over, for your mother...
I wish you the best and hope to see you again.
Love, Dad”
