You attempt to fight off the horde
You begin by attacking the zombie that has just attacked you
You kick him into the engine of the proto-polaris v2.3 and it instantly incinerates

You now stand your ground as the horde gets closer
And closer
And closer
You begin firing your laser pistol
It is no use
The horde overwhelms you
You scream as your flesh is torn apart from your skin
You should have never left home
You should have died with your family
You should not have attempted to fight this horde
Your confidence gets the best of you
And now, there is no more of you

Goodbye Asteroid-2576zâ€¦
