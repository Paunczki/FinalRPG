Another wraith attacks you
You attack its arm that is flailing through the hole in your ship.
You begin to focus too much on this one wraith.
As you look back, you realize how much you underestimated the strength of the wraiths.
On the other side of the ship chunks of your ship were gone now.
You look as the wraiths continued to claw at the walls opening up the holes.
Suddenlyâ€¦

*CRACK*
*SCREECHES*

A wraith has broken through.
You try to stab it out of your ship and attempt to fly away, but it is too late.
A thruster has already been damaged.
Your back hits the control panel and the lights of the ship begin to fade.
All you can see is the growing darkness and the screeches of the wraiths.
Suddenly you feel a stab of pain run from your lower abdomen.
You look down and a scythe has impaled you.
You slowly let the light fade.
