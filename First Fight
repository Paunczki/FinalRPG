Suddenly, you hear a sound outside of the main ship door.
You quickly proceed to run towards the door, and you debate whether to open it or not..
As the seconds pass, you also realize that what seems like the sound of footsteps is
getting closer and closer.
You come to the door

You open the door and an alien pins you to the ground
Alien drool drips onto your ear as the alien stands over you
You quickly grab the laser pistol your father left you and shoot at the alien
The Alien gets off you and a battle begins...
