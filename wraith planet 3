A black cloud explodes as the boss wraith withers to black dust.
The doors to your ship unlock and open up.
You run in and notice some damage in your ship and black lines covering the walls.
You quickly run back out with a test tube and collect some of the dark matter off of the pillar.
As you are running back to your ship, the other wraiths begin to float towards you screeching.
You jump back into your ship and begin to turn on the thrusters.
The wraiths are now surrounding the ship and attacking the exterior.
One of the wraiths begins to break in through one of the side windows.
You look at the dark sky and at the wraith breaking into your ship.
It is your decision. Do youâ€¦
	1. Fight this Wraith (will get you closer to leveling up)
	2. Run the ship and FULL SPEED AHEAD
	3. Fight that Wraith (that is a swole wraith)
Enter your choice:
