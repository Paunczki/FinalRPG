Before we throw you into the action we want to give you a basic tutorial.
The game is based off what you input at any time, so be careful when typing into the console.
This is meant to prevent you from not messing up your player's name or choice.

So when playing there are a few basic things to know...
When you come to a choice selection (really the only interaction you will have in this game),
You want to only enter the number that corresponds to your choice.
Here is an example...
Do you want to...
     1. Explore the ship? 
     2. Full speed ahead?
     3. Access Inventory
For questions like these enter only the number of the decision you choose
For example, say I want to go to a different destination, I will pick 2.
This will look like...
Enter your choice: 2
You then press enter when you have made your decision.


Now for something a bit more complicated.
At most choice stops you will be provided with the option to access your inventory.
The inventory navigates just as any choice where you only enter the number of your choice
There are four items to interact with in the inventory: Weapons, Armor, Food, and Equipped.
	Weapons will show you which weapons you currently have in your inventory/are available
		Your weapon decides the damage you do, usually the higher the level the better
	Armor will show which armor you have per armor slot (helmet, chestplate, boots, etc.)
		Armor adds onto your max health so make sure to be equipping the best
	Food shows you which food items you have
		Food will replenish your health which is especially useful in battles
	Equipped will simply tell you what you have equipped

We will now give you the option to view your inventory.
Press 1 to view and 2 to return to game.
If you do choose to view you inventory, do not view any equipped spaces 
As you do not have anything yet (Once you get to your next choice you can)
Please press 5 (Exit) and then hit enter and the game will begin.
Good luck and have a great adventure...
