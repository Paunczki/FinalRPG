After leaving the zombie planet behind, you have been traveling through space for a couple days.
Your body has grown tired from lack of activity.
As you stare into the endless horizon something catches your eye.
It is a black planet.
There is no sign of life or outline of the terrain on the surface.
You update your ship’s thrusters and slowly move toward the planet.
As you go closer, it looks like an endless void.
You scan the surface for any sign of activity.
You hear a soft buzz, and slowly tilt your head down towards the speaker to get a better read on the sound.
Suddenly a loud screech blasts through the speaker.
You jump back in surprise.
The speaker goes silent.
You dim your ship’s light and slowly descend into the darkness.


There is a bit of turbulence as you enter the planet’s atmosphere.
You turn on your ship’s front lights.
The scene makes your jaw drop.
There are pillars are darkness that hold the sky of blackness up.
Wraiths are floating about the pillars.
Disappearing and reappearing.
You slowly lower your ship down to the surface and the floating wraiths above grow a bit smaller.
Your curiosity heightens and you want to exit your ship to explore this new dark matter.
You exit your ship and slowly walk towards the bottom of the nearest pillar.
Suddenly you feel a gust of wind pass the hairs on your neck.
You look back and two ghostly hollow eyes look right at you.
You grab your weapon and jump back.
