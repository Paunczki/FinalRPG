You survive the battle
The world becomes dark and only a glimmer of light exists directly above you
You quickly race into your drivers seat
Your escape shrinks
Your engine stutters
You think this is it
Then the engine kicks into gear
You point the nose of your ship towards the escape in the sky
Your escape shrinks faster and faster
The acceleration is holding you back
You feel your eyes gluing to the back of your skull
There is only seconds left!
You hold tight
…
You begin to lose breath
…
It is getting darker
…
But you are so close!
… 
You can only remember life back home, Asteroid-2576z
Momma,
Poppa,
Grandma!
… 
Your vision is becoming blurry
Please
Please!!!
…  
And you are out!
You breathe heavily
This is no time for relaxation
It is time to continue your journey…
