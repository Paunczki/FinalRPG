You grab the fuel and sprint as fast as you can.
You retrace your path to the door.
You can hear the alien squid behind you, enraged at you for the demise of the other one.

You reach your proto-polaris and quickly refuel it.
You see the squid approaching as you close the tank up.
You dive onto your ship and seal the doors behind you in the nick of time.
You run to the cockpit and start the engine.

The second squid begins pounding on your ship.
It pounds all over until it finds the cockpit and sees you.
The squid beats even harder and faster when it spots you.
The window is durable, but you don’t want to stick around.
The engine roars to its full potential.
You launch your proto-polaris.

The speed of the ship flings the squid and its hateful gaze from your window.
You continue on your journey.
